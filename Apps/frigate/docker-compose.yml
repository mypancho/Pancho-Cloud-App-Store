      Use of a Google Coral Accelerator is optional, but highly recommended. The Coral will outperform even the best CPUs and can process 100+ FPS with very little overhead.
      * Tight integration with Home Assistant via a custom component
      * Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
      * Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
      * Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
      * Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
      * Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
      * Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
      * 24/7 recording
      * Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
      * WebRTC & MSE support for low-latency live view
      Visit [Frigate](https://frigate.video/) for more details. Check the [documentation](https://docs.frigate.video/) for further settings.

  tips:
    before_install:
      en_us: |
        Frigate will use ports `5000/tcp`, `8554/tcp`, `8555/tcp` and `8555/udp`. After installing further setup is needed.
