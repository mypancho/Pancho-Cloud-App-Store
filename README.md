## ðŸ’¡ Information

This is an `Edge` version of the [Official CasaOS Appstore](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

This version of the CasaOS Appstore attempts to automatically update all the listed apps into their more recent (stable) versions if possible.

The list will update every 24 hours.

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer

This appstore cannot guarantee that the newer version of an app it automatically resolved to is fully stable and working. 

If there is a new update available, it is best to verify from other sources (reddit, github repo) first if the current (more recent) tag referenced in each app is safe to update to.

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

* **I followed and run all the instructions but it seems not working**

    **Solution:** 
    
    _Adding third-party appstores only works on CasaOS v0.4.4 and above._
    
    _Upgrade your CasaOS to at least [v0.4.4](https://blog.casaos.io/blog/23.html)_

* **I receive an Error 404 Not found when running the register command.**

    **Solution:**
    
    _It could be that your CasaOS is running on a port other than port `80`._ 
    
    _You need to tell the command which port your CasaOS is running by passing the `-u` flag together with the `host` and `port`._

    _For example, if my CasaOS is running on port `90`:_

        casaos-cli app-management register app-store https://casaos-appstore.paodayag.dev/edge.zip -u "localhost:90"
